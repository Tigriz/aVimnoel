## Development

To test your modifications locally, you can change the name of the script by adding `dev` and the script will automatically fetch files from http://127.0.0.1:8080

You can use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to serve your files locally
```sh
http-server . --cors
```
